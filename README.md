# Analysis-on-Handwritten-Documents
The basis of the problem analysized in this work is a current argument being debated by a team of researchers lead by Prof. Michael Caliguri. These researchers are exploring the relationship between kinematics of handwritten text and the ability of forensic document examiners to determine if two documents were written by the same writer. However, a side debate has risen among them which is whether statisticians and machine learning experts can build a reasonably accurate classifier that predicts three things at once 1. The writer of a short note (40 writers) 2. Which of 6 phrases was written 3. What type/style of writing was used (Print or Script) based on the kinematic features recorded by MovAlyzeR.
