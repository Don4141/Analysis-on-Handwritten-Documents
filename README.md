# Analysis-on-Handwritten-Documents. 
The basis of the problem analyzed in this work is a current argument being debated by a team of researchers lead by Prof. Michael Caliguri. These researchers are exploring the relationship between kinematics of handwritten text and the ability of forensic document examiners to determine if two documents were written by the same writer. However, a side debate has risen among them thinking whether or not statisticians and machine learning experts can build a reasonably accurate classifier that can predict three things at once; (1) The writer of a short note, (2) Among 6 phrases ('Our London business is good', 'but Vienna and Berlin are quiet', 'Mr. Lloyd has gone to Switzerland', 'and I hope for good news', 'He will be there for a week', 'And then goes to Turin'), the phrase written by the writer (3) The type/style of writing used (Print or Script) based on the kinematic features recorded by MovAlyzeR. Hence, the objective of this project is to use the provided data to build a classifier that is reasonably accurate in predicting the three things. Two data sets (labeled and unlabeled) were provided. The labeled data has 30 columns with 103,311 rows and the unlabeled data has 150 rows with 27 columns
